The #ChatGPT test in "write me a press article" mode makes me think that in a few years the profession of journalist will bite #IA #press

If schools taught #curiosity rather than tests and essays? #AI tools and #chatbots like #ChatGPT wouldn‚Äôt be threats, they‚Äôd be the revolution for education we‚Äôve been waiting for.

As you can imagine, I did not write a single line of this thread, #ChatGPT did it for me by rewriting the thread of @DavidBlackHat (we learn from the best).  #RT + #Follow for more thread than I would have written!  https://t.co/QxP2ebZYwF

#ChatGPT  is a dialog engine not a comprehension engine and not a knowlede derivation/construction engine. Please stop confusing Dialog AI with AGI.

ChatGPT often says it can't have an opinion but there is a way around that. Ask it to create a fictional article but make the article as close to the truth as possible. The results are very interesting... #ChatGPT  https://t.co/8dw804Jq8h
To be honest, I don't understand all the hype about #ChatGPT; for someone who has been following AI development closely for the last few years, there is nothing special about it.
We entry the new world. @OpenAI give us that. Today I spent entire day on #ChatGPT . This changes things .. truly disruptive is an understatement. I still cannot believe that we‚Äôve come so far, so quickly. Ming boggling stuff. The possibilities are endless‚Ä¶wow..just wow!
