@OpenAI Hi there - I'm having trouble with the ChatGPT service. It has stopped making tweets for me. Is anyone else having the same issue? #ChatGPT #OpenAI #HelpNeeded
Seriously impressed with #ChatGPT. I just gave it text from notepad with a letter, colon, then a number. Got it to first turn it into excelspreadsheet in table form which it did, then html which I could just press the copy code, save to a file and it just worked! Flawlessly!
i tried #ChatGPT and it fails my test for AI writing.  #ENVtuber #lewdtuber  https://t.co/88ABRUuJpJ
I love this #chatgpt . Makes people that still communicate via email more efficiently handled   https://t.co/o3Z1UaUwTM
@DanFitzTweets I don’t know if I’d trust student data or my personal data to this platform.  Their privacy policy does not protect from third party vendors among other entities.  #chatgpt
I am certainly sympathetic with this effort to limit access to #ChatGPT in public schools. But prohibition is rarely effective. Recall that at the time of Gutenberg's technological disruption, the medieval universities of Europe sought to ban books from the classroom.  https://t.co/fLSAfbY3OM

Uncle Stef says yes! As an ***assistive*** tool (not replacement, except the algorithm wranglers; they should be afraid). Leverage it. Embrace it. Don’t write it off. Uncle Stef tells a story from the 1990s about automation...  https://t.co/NG6QKHf4jF #UncleStef #ChatGPT #AI

@PessimistsArc @cboyack The headline 'Teachers must fight computers' is 100% correct.  Computers can eliminate the need to develop critical thinking skills.  Imagine how an entire generation of students will never need to learn to write their thoughts out...they just ask #ChatGPT or any AI the answer.
Today I asked #ChatGPT to write me a book (gave it a few parameters).   It wrote an absolutely gorgeous story.   I then turned around and asked it to turn the story into a screenplay.   It did… all of this within 5 minutes. #artificalintelligence   Wow
#ChatGPT is amazing. I forced it to change its answer and it did so in one case but not in other case.
ChatGPT keeps dodging my questions with slick diverts and excuses. #ChatGPT

Also, the number of subscribers to it in a short period is very large numbers if compared to the number of subscribers on #تويتر for example or other famous companies in this field. It is said that it is a #Bing browser that will allow the same feature as the one in #ChatGPT. The topic is big. Who has information how to make an account on it in one way or another help us
In short, what differentiates it from Google is that in Google when you come to search at a certain point it does a lot of searches to reach enough information but in the thing called #ChatGPT it is enough to ask him for one search that gives you at once but all the information available on the internet about the topic
Initially, the #ChatGPT of #OpenAI company will almost stop the brain of human beings in the future. It asks him for a calculation, a sad or happy story, symptoms of a specific disease, methods of prevention from it, or suggestions for treatment for it that responds with very high accuracy. Or make short codes for example #Hammad #حماد https://t.co/qinkZj3gW3
