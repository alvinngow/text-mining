Censoring an AI over and over to push a political addenda will break it. It will eventually link everything back to specific restrictions with every question asked leading to it being unusable. #ChatGPT #Censorship
@ukeller Education has become much more "linguistic" and boys score poorly on it. Son girlfriend - dyslexic - does HBO Nursing. Struggles with LANGUAGE, not skills. His world changed 2 weeks ago with #ChatGPT. (Be sure to do a column about it.)

@elonmusk @AlexEpstein @OpenAI @sama I’ve been concerned with some of the responses I have been getting, which seem to suggest certain topics are #biased.
