Has anyone recently noticed signs #chatGPT is scaling back it's abilities? I used to be able to search and aggregate tweets on any theme or search top/ best most whatever in *. Now it refuses prompts more n' more. Hope the woke minority are not wielding influence. #gpt3 @OpenAI
But the capabilities of a good developer or researcher don't lie in the code, it's the thought that goes behind that code. Here it is in #chatGPT's own words:  https://t.co/TePm3HsTFq
I really like #chatGPT and all other models that produce text or code and no I don't think they will replace anyone. And people should start to think of their applications. We want to advance our work and to do so we need everything to be more efficient.
Thread on #ChatGPT, and why I think that, yes, it will become a massively influential functionality that will turbo charge productive capacity in dozens of sectors, it won't just replace jobs, it'll make new ones and let us do more than we can now; but, we need some time. /1  https://t.co/QFRtESlh37

These started showing up in my #chatGPT responses. Looks like it's typing some markdown code but is it trying to pull training data or spontaneously pulling up random IDs?  https://t.co/O0bKM32IjL

#ChatGPT and #AlphaCode platforms open speculation that the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) capable of imitating humans will occur. Take it easy, guys, the existence of 'skynet' like the movie 'terminator' will not happen in our lifetime üòâüôÇüòâ https://t.co/PF4TKCYHov

An answer for everything and everyone: "My main function is to assist with tasks and answer questions to the best of my ability within the bounds of my training and knowledge." #ChatGPT
Another amazing example of #ChatGPT (found in @bentossell's awesome AI newsletter)  SumUp - create bite-sized summaries of news articles üëá  https://t.co/QzYvBYmSPa
I was impressed when I asked this morning ChatGPT to tell me how to create a modal in Angular. Very clear steps and explanation.   What have you done with #ChatGPT so far? üëá

#ChatGPT might be good at fiction and well known facts, but try it on anything slightly obscure. It sounds confident spewing inaccurate junk. Just sayin‚Äô

Hey @CosmicSkeptic, @vegan_logic, @PlantBasedNews, @itsdavidramms, @JoeyCarbstrong and @DrNealBarnard have you conversed with @openaicommunity by @OpenAI about veganism?  It could be interesting to watch you interact with it and see what comes out üå±  #vegan #plantbased #ChatGPT

Passing the Turing Test is boring. This is not "moving the goal posts."  Thoughtful critics have been saying all along that "fooling humans from behind a keyboard" was a bad test ‚Äì‚Äì because humans are easy to fool.  This is also not a criticism of #ChatGPT, which is very good.
Job Applicants have started leveraging #ChatGPT to crack their interview and that would blew Interviewer mind indeed üòÖ
I'm chatting with clients and office peers about the AI research and product company OpenAI. It's inspirational learning how colleagues use ChatGPT, the generative chatbot from OpenAI.

The #Unity documentation itself is rich and polite, but when it becomes more advanced, I don't know what it says, so I feel that if I let #ChatGPT read it and understand it, my understanding will deepen considerably.

@recrutainment Thanks for this blog post. So it's really time for cover letters to disappear. Especially since 3 years ago 75 percent of 100 recruiters surveyed ticked that they could do without a cover letter. However, 75% absolutely wanted a CV. Does #chatGPT also write CVs?
It's funny how coders understand that #ChatGPT  reading tons of github repos isn't stealing but artists can't comprehend that Stable Diffusion reading #ArtStation posts also isn't. #AI #AIart

@learngpt Got astonished getting the replies from the #AI. I must agree that it saved 3 hours of review and reading. It would be more interesting if a scholar version of the #ChatGPT will show the results with References of the sourceüòä

To be fair people are hard, but at least I have a unique name. Not many Kenst's.  I also asked about my uncle, a published writer. #ChatGPT mixed him up with someone else with the same name.  https://t.co/hJXwANbItI
