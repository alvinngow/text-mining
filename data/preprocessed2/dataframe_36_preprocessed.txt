If you ask ChatGPT to create a comic that the current job will disappear due to automation by AI, it seems that you can create a fairly good composition.  Eventually, there will be comic artists who use ChatGPT. I'm looking forward to it.   https://t.co/XZCSjtoBfO #chatGPT #Êº´Êâç #„Éç„Çø‰Ωú„Çä

@rosecat991 @derStandardat Did the prosecution withdraw him? They probably mean citizenship. Which, of course, is also wrong. Here is a good example of why #ChatGPT is a stupid AI.

@jimcramer #chatgpt mentions AMD, a semiconductor stock that is a favorite of @jimcramer , a well-known financial commentator. The speaker suggests that someone who is paying a high price for AMD shares must know something that others do not, implying that the stock may be overvalued.
this goes straight to my meme collection #ChatGPT  https://t.co/3Pt9k8nYZb
@jimcramer from #chatgpt #2 The speaker then makes an observation that the owners of these different types of stocks cannot all be correct in their assessments. In other words, some of these stocks may be overvalued or undervalued.
