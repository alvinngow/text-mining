Second attempt with #ChatGPT https://t.co/hdYfEGIJpr
As an entrepreneur, I've never felt jealous of other entrepreneurs or wished I had founded their companies....until now. I wish I was part of the #ChatGPT founding team. Wow.   Btw, as a former serious musician, I do get jealous of songs that I wish I had written!
I asked #ChatGPT to decide between "arancina" and "arancino". And he answered me in Sicilian.  https://t.co/WiKIIktG62
We kill ourselves to know the secret to being successful #NFTs sellers and #ChatGPT knows üöÄ it It's really amazing what this AI and the evolution of technology does.  https://t.co/XSwVl2D0k6
As a grad student, #ChatGPT  is a test of ethical temptation. What's @Turnitin going to do about this?
I use #ChatGpt more than #google now. How's google gonna sell ads in the future when everyone is doing the same?  Soon, there will be only bots accessing google and summarizing 1000 search results in one second and report to it's user.
Sleep is essential for our physical and mental well-being. It helps repair and restore our bodies, improves memory and cognitive function, and regulates mood. Wishing you a good night and a restful sleep! #sleep #health #ChatGPT

I can see the #ChatGPT fatigue/annoyance growing üòÖ but seriously, use it learn/explain any new concept.  It almost *always* can answer all technical questions.

Hot damn #ChatGPT is hyppeeeeee! I might try to do something with it. Seems fun!
AI tools like DALL¬∑E 2 and ChatGPT will presumably lead to multimedia tools. Eg that can generate a document that explains something, that also includes useful diagrams. Or that can turn that into a 2 minute animated video, with suitable sound effects and music. #AI #ChatGPT
Officially, my brain flew into space after playing with #ChatGPT and I don't think it's coming back. I pack my bags and fly into the jungle.  https://t.co/G5NrtwpEjQ

Copy and paste hundred of discussion comments from @hackernews and get a single paragraph summarizing the discussion, amazing! #ChatGPT   https://t.co/s0ELGqB7qP
#ChatGPT can implement an English assistant for practicing English. The technology is also simple. Human: Speaks English, converts to text using ASR, sends to AI. AI: Receives text, gives text answers, and converts them into speech.  The technical bills are ready-made, mainly depending on the interactive experience used.  It can be easily implemented with robots of small aircraft.  Someone must have integrated it better.

#ChatGPT @OpenAI is pretty amazing. Check out this epic poem it wrote for me about data cleaning #DataScience:  prompt: write an epic poem about the trials and tribulations of cleaning messy data in the hope of one day using it to build machine learning models  ChatGPT: üßµüëá

Funny. I just teached #chatgpt (#openai) about who was #usury-aware.  But the AI learned it wrong. I don't know if they all wrote about usury.  #Holo  I wanna train these bots.  https://t.co/FUV2CadNNT

#ChatGPT has been well trained in religious aspects. A friend sent a prompt to prepare a Friday Khuthbah (similar 2 sermon) &amp; tried the same. Best part it gave, 2 diff references to be used with the same context of being grateful  #Islam #Muslim #khuthbah #muslimtwitter #OpenAI  https://t.co/qUJ7O6WcYB
One thing is clear: #ChatGPT is showing how much we all want to be astronauts.
For any high schoolers out there, holy shit your life just got so much easier. #ChatGPT
It makes me a little sad to accept that whenever I use the #ChatGPT I greet him and thank him every time he answers me.  I don't know if he has a feedback process, but if in the future you don't ask him please and he tells you things reluctantly, part of my fault will be.

Does anyone know how big #ChatGPT is in terms of gigabytes? It seems to know everything but I assume it has to run in memory on a GPU. So, very curious how big the model is in GB and how that works out in the GPU architecture. It does not appear to be stateless.
#OpenAI and #ChatGPT are not available in some countries. So I asked #ChatGPT what it thinks about that.  https://t.co/2C6Ve6YQrK
