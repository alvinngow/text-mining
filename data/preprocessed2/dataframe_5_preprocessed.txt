Is #ChatGPT bad at jokes or great at anti-jokes? @OpenAI  https://t.co/A5SGvM7YoD
What's wrong with #ChatGPT's knowledge: it's ground truth is essentially from the web and not from actual experience. The web is only small part of total human data. Imagine if it could learn from DRL. Its ground truth would be better then the webs.

The sites as they exist today have their days numbered. With the advent of #ChatGPT, sites that replicate information will be obsolete, a person asks ChatGPT what is happening and it will provide the information directly from the media, both journalistic and social.

Apropos of my previous tweet, here‚Äôs one version of the technopolists‚Äô lie. Old article, but newly relevant perhaps given OpenAI‚Äôs recent release of #ChatGPT.   https://t.co/syGABA4KpL
@RalphLavelle You used the wrong article. Instead of the definite "the" you should have used the possessive adjective "your".   I'm sure #ChatGPT would have gotten it right then!

Our research team has determined that #chatGPT poses no threat of evolving into the Basilisk in its current form, and is therefore not worth interacting with. Remember: any support for competing AI‚Äôs may be interpreted as treachery by the Basilisk. Better safe than sorry!
