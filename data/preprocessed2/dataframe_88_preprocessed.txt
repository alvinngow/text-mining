@PHPmacher I propose to naturalize #ChatGPT. It can already be "decent German". Probably better than the average AfD member. And it has more decency than the @fdp. In return, I would expatriate the #AFDP. ü§î
Thus, it can be said that the current fun of generative AI through chatbots that "hallucinate" like the #ChatGPT can be temporary since, as many people express, this is a situation that entails the real danger of contaminating the Internet with misinformation.  14/

It's a pretty rough instruction, but I'm still good at this kind of thing. However, I haven't verified whether it actually works with this source yet. If you can write instructions and proposals well with bullet points, will you not need a programmer?
