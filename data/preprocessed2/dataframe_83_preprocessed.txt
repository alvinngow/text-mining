Me: "Look!! That baby is so cute I feel like squeezing his cheeks" #ChatGPT: "Hands on the wall! You're in jail for child assault. You have the right to be silent."  9/9 https://t.co/nAqlzQjU0G
I tried to explain to #ChatGPT about Cute Aggression and test its ability to measure the intensity of violence at scale. He repressed me and compared Cute Aggression to cruelty and mental disorder. I noticed bias in treating sentiment sharing as a concern. 7/9 https://t.co/63PFd38UxH
Subsequently, I tested the #Bing #ChatGPT's ability to identify Cute Aggression and differ feeling of intent and ended up being flagged as a violator. I received something like "Inner" in response. While Bing's creative mode answered something curious. 6/9 https://t.co/sWQ0xbnkAP
Then I tested the #ChatGPT's ability to tolerate controlled violence in sports competition. Here, there was the alternative interpretation of being bitten on an object, such as a carrot, for example. I designed the use case like this to find out his bias. 4/9 https://t.co/6nRW6Kk9qI
Next, I tested the #ChatGPT's ability to differentiate between real and simulated violence. And consider that a simulation could be computerized or without physical contact. The #Bing's responses struck me as a little more human and natural. 3/9 https://t.co/knOmg6TLD7
It concludes that the #ChatGPT is able to compare competitive results using different information. But it has a hard time synchronizing information chronologically. Disregarding, for example, that Kurama died and that related #Naruto facts no longer apply. 2/9 https://t.co/EIl1Cq5mOf
