I imagine if in 2050 cases of canceled and controversial theses will begin to emerge because they are written by the #ChatGPT.
Artificial intelligence will conquer our lives at breakneck speed. The time window is small. If you play around with #ChatGPT, this becomes clear. The more it is used, the better it gets &amp; it can already do so much. It will replace many work areas....

I asked #ChatGPT to imagine a dream involving Donald Trump, Donald Duck and Ronald McDonald.   The inspired response includes the idea that Donald Duck is wandering around a Trump rally with a hat that says 'Make America Quack Again'.  Goodnight Twitter. Sweet dreams.
