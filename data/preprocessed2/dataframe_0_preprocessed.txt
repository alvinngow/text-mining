This prompt was created with #ChatGPT the new @OpenAI ü§Ø chat model, the following #MartesDeDatos in @platzi we will talk about #ChatGPT and text-davinci-003 the new models for GPT3. üíöüöÄ https://t.co/2cZVInL9bD
Just played around with OpenAI's new #ChatGPT model and asked it to write a poem about embodied carbon in buildings. This is what I got...   Try out ChatGPT  https://t.co/vaov2Ttluo  #embodiedcarbon #poetry  https://t.co/DbgO6Qz2Zq
I asked #ChatGPT to write me a story about Sova and Jett falling in love...  https://t.co/yyZNrFRTQs
OpenAI's new ChatGPT is very good at creative writing.  #openAI #chatGPT #poetry #Bitcoin  https://t.co/yxMfXVjxDB
This is a great improvement! Unlike text-davinci-003, #ChatGPT understands the context from previous user‚Äôs answers.
#ChatGPT #OpenAI Wow!  https://t.co/aMUgPMtuoa
My mind is blown. I cannot believe how good ChatGPT from OpenAI is. I see this already replacing a lot of googling tasks I do, 100% right out of the box. I don‚Äôt even know what to say anymore. I must be doing something wrong. Someone please break it for me! #ChatGPT
Absolutely insane. I asked #chatGPT to generate a simple personal website.   It showed step by step on how to create it, then added HTML and CSS.   The output was used on @Replit. ü§Ø  https://t.co/yLigabNMAO
It is incredible how #chatgpt manages to propose an analysis of such magnitude and with a lot of sense @DotCSV https://t.co/AL4pMsgqN3

#ChatGPT from #OpenAI is here!
The new #chatGPT from @openAI (thanks to @GuyP) is just astonishing: had a very interesting and illuminating conversation, although limited by its (structural) inability to access the web in real time. Much better than _anything_ ($&gt;=0) I've tried before.  Looking forward to GPT4

Bouncing some ideas off my new AI friend here. &gt; Yes, having the power to control entropy would likely allow you to stop things from moving on a molecular level. By manipulating the entropy of an object, you could reduce its energy and slow down or halt its movement. #ChatGPT

New model in town: #ChatGPT. Will read on weekend. Early experiments seem impressive until you remember it's trained on limited data, sandboxed.  Can you imagine "streaming" models, ingesting news, tweets, youtube vids real time? We ain't seen nothin yet.  https://t.co/cggRoU1TnL
AI can design games as well as game art now!! ü§©  I asked #ChatGPT by @OpenAI to design games about AI, then here is what I got, using the responses as prompts in #midjourneyV4 ... Not just image #AIart, but a starting point for human designers‚ú®  ‚¨áÔ∏è üßµ  https://t.co/sWU6IxAOmu

AI is trained using up to 10 billion quadrillion operations. That's 10^25. There are only 10^14 atoms in a human cell, and 10^20 cells in a human body. More is different: with more you go from physics to chemistry to biology. It was just time. #ChatGPT #AIart  https://t.co/6REtiu6jmB

ChatGPT may not be a replacement for Google, but it is an extremely interesting tool to use for writing fiction or to simply have fun with it.  I told it to "write the ten commandments of software development" üòÄ What do you think? They surely look solid! #ChatGPT  https://t.co/QKHzCxuu02
