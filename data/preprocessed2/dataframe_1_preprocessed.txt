People are excited about ChatGPT's ability to expand bullet points into well-written text, but they should be more impressed by its ability to condense lengthy text into a few key points. #ChatGPT #WritingCommunity

Worried about another Christmas having to explain NFTs to your family? I asked #ChatGPT to explain NFTs to a 5-year-old to help me out‚Ä¶  NFTs are like special stickers that you can use to show that something is yours and no one else's. For example, if you have a picture that you

I asked #chatgpt to tell a story from the mainstream media's perspective. Then "The same story, but told from the perspective of alternative media that catches wind.":   "We at the Alternative Media Network are not fooled by the mainstream media's lies". Wow.  #ai #ufotwitter  https://t.co/7UzHomesOp
@pmddomingos Maybe this is just a hallucinated Twitter inside of #ChatGPT  perhaps there never really was a Twitter.
#Royal #ChatGPT Yesterday I went on chatGPT with promises to "beat Google" from others. I asked what a dog ate. It couldn't accurately tell. An hour ago I prompted it to, "Write an essay on news." It began to load. It did so with or without the internet. It is at 1453.2 files.  https://t.co/BBrWb0uKzf

Well, it has had me an entertaining time #ChatGPT convincing me that in GIFT format you could put calculated questions and giving me example codes, which did not work. until I told her I couldn't find it anywhere and now she tells me she was wrong...
I'm really surprised with #ChatGPT. I asked him to do a basic automation script with Python and he succeeds in doing it!  I am surprised and at the same time a little worried that this will fall into the hands of bad actors (or that the AI itself will redefine its ethics).  https://t.co/cjBMpqFIUF
