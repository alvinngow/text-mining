#ChatGPT I tried using it and it seems to be quite useful. It takes a lot of time to think about how to write a business email, but if you type in what you want to tell these people, they will present you with a decent sentence. Also, if you look up the foreign language typesetting rules on the website of the language of that country and ask me to explain it in Japanese, he will tell you easily!
