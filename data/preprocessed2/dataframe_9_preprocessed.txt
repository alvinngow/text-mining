#openai #ChatGPT I love it, but it can't spell.  I lost a round of hangman to it.  https://t.co/bi4DQYgBiX
chatGPT is shocking. It also writes troublesome code. I don't think this will take away the jobs of engineers, but it will dramatically increase their productivity.  The capture is the result of trying "writing a code in JavaScript that reduces the brightness of hexadecimal color codes by 10%".  I could imagine a world that I didn't google when I touched it. #chatGPT https://t.co/nX3HNx3V8H
What's the DuckDuckGo !bang for #ChatGPT ? @DuckDuckGo @OpenAI
We need a table to list where #ChatGPT is strong (i.e. with easy verification of truth) to where it is weak (i.e. with most obvious hallucination) together with a column which describes how to automatically verify the answers.

I've not personally interacted with #ChatGPT or #GPT4 but does any one remember 1966's Eliza and, more specifically, users reactions to its seeming ability to conversationally "connect".

The new OpenAI ChatGPT is out of this world! This NLP model generates human-like text in real time, and it's seriously mind-blowing. ü§Ø If you're looking to create a conversational AI or messaging bot, ChatGPT is the way to go. ü§ñ #OpenAI #ChatGPT #NLP #conversationalAI
@CFDevelop Nope. They're not entirely grounded in reality. I've seen #ChatGPT reference Nuget packages that don't actually exist (and as far as I know, have never existed at all). It's a great way to come up with quick prototypes, but you'll still need a real person to validate the design

@shanelindsay @cloudquistador Interesting but wrong in both content and form.  I prefer #ChatGPT's "honesty" : )
I just heard that Google is banning #chatgpt as it bans automatically generated content as spam.   I think an #AI detector service has a market. If someone going to sic a chatbot on you you can just learn to ignore them.   Sounds like the end of twitter
