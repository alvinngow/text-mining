ChatGPT and human laziness give you the right answer. Great, isn't it? They give you advice, but people don't always do it. I hear about it, but it's hard to execute. Easier said than done, it will never change. There are too many temptations in this day and age. I have to eat something sweet. #ChatGPT #先延ばし癖 https://t.co/IaXyVwQIZZ

@Altcoin_Gold Yep, 2 weeks ago it was all about perp dexes. And now we're getting some serious interest with the AI narrative that happened with #chatgpt, so the timing of TAO's drop on MEXC and their utility is just golden.
@ch402 For the number rounding example, though #ChatGPT handles the 48-digit number, we can't say it "fully learns how to round numbers", but we should use the preliminary operations to say it "first copies the 46-digit 23...2 and then captures the 'round ... 49.5' to '50' skip-trigram"
#ChatGPT can be characterized by input and settings. So, ideally, you should tailor it to your #自社 or #自分 rather than using a generic service. Nowadays, the part that is more convenient than search is amazing, and attention is focused on the fact that we have released a service that is quick to win, but such an era will soon end.

By all means, give the official #ChatGPT for #slack an API to get the unread timestamp, which is not provided to general users, and provide a summary function for the unread part! !! I can't do that.
@AlphaCryptOmega @bittensor_ Yep, and honestly, the hype that #chatgpt has built was only through their chat function. Just wait till TAO gets more exposure like it did on mexc and refines its utility, man, it'll be game over.

#ChatGPT there are people who think ChatGPT needs to know them and otherwise know their truths. They are disappointed when they realize that they have been wrong. They suffer when they learn.
