Missed our service last Sunday? The Gospel reading is from Matthew 6:24-34.   We asked #ChatGPT to write a hymn based on this reading.  Using the tune St Anne (O God Our Help in Ages Past) it suggested the following 👇   https://t.co/V6k6CEQ3YB  #God #Church #Worship #SingAlong
I started using ChatGPT. As with the information you want to know, it helps to have a cohesive and easy-to-read sentence. This is used for reports. But I feel that the information is still shallow (because it is Japanese?) We will be driven to accumulate more accurate knowledge. #ChatGPT
I tried it I feel like I can collect and summarize the biographies of celebrities from information on the Internet, and I feel that it is dangerous that I can misuse it to collect personal information for stalking and hitting the Internet ... I'm a little curious to see what comes out when I look it up with my name and address, 💦 but ~ I don't know if it's correct information #chatGPT https://t.co/yNubZv9lr9

ChatGPT is too interesting! It even provides 🥺 code and can also be copied from CSS and HTML. AI only summarizes information on the Internet and responds, so there is misinformation and confirmation work, but it would be very convenient if you made the foundation so crisply and you can 🤔 save time It's an amazing era ...!  #chatGPT #AI https://t.co/SXwH52hqby

"#ChatGPT is cool, for sure," @sama said. "And people really love it, which makes us very happy. But no one would say this was a great, well-integrated product yet," adding that it's more of a version "0.7" rather than a "1.0 version."   https://t.co/CiBRJFrhJK

"Questioning ability" is usually tested in various situations, but using #ChatGPT reaffirms the importance of clarifying "what you want to know" and "how to ask". In terms of acquiring knowledge, I may no longer need anything else.
One amazing thing about #ChatGPT is that you can actually get it to improvise role playing games!   Right now It’s calling me “Doctor” and acting as HAL 9000 and we’re visiting an alien planet where we’ve found alien quantum comms tech that we’re studying!  #AI  https://t.co/6mGuNbIQiC

The early release of large language models like #ChatGPT is beneficial for society. 🧵  We are seeing inaccurate results and truly unhinged conversations, which is a great reminder that AI technology should not be trusted blindly.  /1  https://t.co/gyT0tJLcyi
I don't think it's a good idea to think of a dialogue with an AI like #ChatGPT as "I can use it without thinking about it because the other party will give me a convenient answer." It's the same with human interaction. The attitude of "I don't think about anything, so just give me a quick answer" would be bad whether the other party is an AI or a human.

AI thought of "why the threshold of the church is high". No, it's too good. #ChatGPT "However, anyone is welcome to join the church, and if they are interested, they can learn about church customs and rituals by referring to the church's website and information boards." https://t.co/nwBmcTxiDe
I asked ChatGPT for 5 case citations that spoke to a given factual matrix. It answered with 5 citations including name, year, reporter, and page number.  I submitted a request for copies to the Qld Supreme Court Library who replied by saying that no such cases existed.  #ChatGPT

The text of the email received from genuine humanity far exceeded AI. This is great for the other party, but it is also the quality of the instructions I give to the AI. It has become similar to the "what is a good specification" problem. #ChatGPT
