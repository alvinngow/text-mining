#GPT4 is expected to have improved capabilities compared to its predecessor, GPT-3 or #ChatGPT. It is expected to improve natural language processing, language support, and programming capabilities.
What is #GPT4:  It stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer 4, and its an #AI language model that is currently in development. Its the successor of #ChatGPT, which has a lots of applications, including natural language processing, chatbots and language translation.
