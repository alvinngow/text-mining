Well, if the AI bot has all the answers, there is really no need for human involvement, so these answers are for reference only. That said, I get the point across. All that remains is for humans to dig deeper. I felt that it had the research capacity of the Legislative Examination Bureau of the National Diet Library. #ChatGPT Reya Amaharu

"While it can be argued that the accumulated knowledge may have some degree of individuality as a distinct collection of information, it is important to note that it is not a conscious entity and does not have personal opinions, emotions, or intentions."  #ChatGPT #AI #BasedAI  https://t.co/DFVRK3iOJD
@HammerOJustice1 @worldnetdaily @TheDCPolitics @FoxNews @foxnewspolitics @realDailyWire @AmericanThinker @CNN @MSNBC @CBSNews @ABC I'm only reporting what #ChatGPT says. It considers these to be unreliable sources for information. I don't know how it decides which is which. That is a question those sources should be asking.
I get asked quite often recently what the difference between Google and ChatGPT is:  Isn't it [ChatGPT] just a search engine? Will it just print out results like Google those? How does it differ.

ChatGPT can also be used as a learning tool. I asked them to illustrate a simple script, and I could read the process myself and check for mistakes.
