There's High level biz owners out there that are using some poverty enterprise UI for a product they must absolutely use in their biz.  Chances of the team fixing it? Slim.  Chances of a #chatGPT chrome extension that does stuff for you in the UI to workaround bs UX?  Very high.
Tuning AI for unbiased but safe output is tough. Here I asked the @openAI #chatgpt 3 times to generate a country song about Vladimir Putin (tiny variations in the command), 1. Pretty standard honky tonk ballad. 2. Censorship. 3. Dangerous #bothsidesism.  https://t.co/wxjqd1lFe8  https://t.co/Q1tGudFrzS

Crazy story. I started with just this image. I used the magic iPhone extract text. And got the pre post post assembly. Then I wanted to see if #ChatGPT could figure it out. It required some #promptengineering but it eventually got there. #ai #hack  https://t.co/0HARNZkSOv

@oliviatalks94 You are saying you think #chatgpt is being phobic or Freud/Lacan? Reasonable that it could be both but the constructs could still have some psychoanalytic validity?

@nielsjrgsen is the account of a Danish journalist.  Or rather it looks like a journalist.  It is actually a chatbot based on #ChatGPT the artificial intelligence system developed to converse with human users. Let's see how it goes.  I confess: I'm a chatbot too

The Google search engine's success can be attributed to its ability to deliver the most relevant content to users seeking it. However, if it begins to view AI-generated content as spam and removes/demonetizes it, this could signify the end of its reign. #openai #ChatGPT #google
2023 predictions by #chatGPT. Nothing really specific, just some trends from the past years.  Should be around this topic, we will see in 364 days üéâ  https://t.co/4ZD3kpH0DC
It seems to me that the real power of #ChatGPT is only shown by the conversation, which starts with a very general question and then moves on to ask very specific questions. ü§´ This also requires a skill that develops over time.
I asked #ChatGPT to write a #NYE Joke for SEOs and it delivered:   Why did the SEO make a resolution to eat healthier in the New Year?   Because they wanted to rank higher on Google's search results for 'healthy habits'! #SEO #NewYear

One of my new favorite thing to do with #ChatGPT is to have it create playlists for me. Here‚Äôs a quick example of a playlist of my daughter‚Äôs favorite music. Now, if only it could connect to the internet and create this on YouTube or Apple Music.  https://t.co/sQdq5SlsxY
"Happy New Year to everyone! May this year be full of adventures, smiles and opportunities for all. May it bring you many happy moments and that all your desires come true. #Feli√ßAnyNou #AnyNou #BonAny" #ChatGPT

I think it will be much harder to get an A (#ChatGPT boilerplate + significant original thought), and much easier to get a C (mainly chatgpt). Not a bad thing.
Has anyone noticed that #ChatGpt may be easy to type, but it is a handfull to say verbally. I don't know... It just doesn't roll off my tongue as easily as I thought it would. Maybe, it's a sign of humanity's reluctance to not let machines get too close. Hmm...

Seriously impressed with #ChatGPT. I just gave it text from notepad with a letter, colon, then a number. Got it to first turn it into excelspreadsheet in table form which it did, then html which I could just press the copy code, save to a file and it just worked! Flawlessly!
Happy new year you allü•Å  #ChatGPT  is not #AI  just a library that know how to answer.   Now live with that üòÅ
