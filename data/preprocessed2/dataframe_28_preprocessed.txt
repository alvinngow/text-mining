I asked the recently popular ChatAMC Q: How many types of laws are there?  A: Really? Laws are roughly divided into two types. Only the parties policing violations may or may not. Simply put, civil law and criminal law. Everyone makes mistakes in administrative law. I may have misunderstood, but everyone is involved, right?  #ChatGPT

Compared to the longer versions, which encouraged me, each presumably punchier draft became more &amp; more toothless, w/ #ChatGPT seemingly unable to sort strength from weakness. Whereas human editing can sharpen, the #AI editing seemed to blunt, resulting in a tepid final version:

#ChatGPT and #GoogleAI are overrated. They are nothing more than Dr. Sbaitso from 1992 hooked up to the internet, reading you the best search results found. They are not even hooked up to an UNBIASED search engine lol. #overrated

#chatGPT It's very popular. Intel is already using machine learning for design. Don't optimize. I wish you could write my experimental code. Is it faster to write than to explain the specifications (laughs)?
#ChatGPT He answers questions about programming and makes music and novels as requested. The more you teach something, the more you memorize it along with the information. Interesting, isn't it?
#Bing #ChatGPT When I touched Bing, I thought it was smarter and more interesting than ChatGPT.  ChatGPT couldn't make haiku, but Bing did. (As far as I searched, it didn't seem to come from somewhere) However, I could not make a couplet (connecting my five hundred and seventy-five with the phrase under seventy-seven).
Microsoft has added #AI to its #Bing search engine, but you know what #chatGPT needs is just that, a search box for previous chats. I can't find a previous chat! :(

Instead of talking #siri or #okgoogle we must call in and ask the #ai like #chatgpt and it displays the query in text the way chatgpt does. This will be convenient. Like how we interact to a friends message.
Great to see #ChatGPT’s API pricing but as an investor I’m still worried about the stability of that price…  Founders could build based on today’s unit cost structure only to have the rug pulled and the price hiked up 10x (or any x) if the overall value is considered great.
@SEO : @dshap_automator, what are your thoughts on the new #ChatGPT API release? I'm disappointed in what I am seeing so far. But I'm likely not seeing the possibilities yet :) Excited to get your take. (via Twitter  https://t.co/j19ZqBlPOh)  https://t.co/i8Xj0I3UY0
