I‚Äôve explored #ChatGPT in depth as well. Not by adding this many subsequent prompts to filter things down though. What do you think, edu-friends?

This post isn‚Äôt a joke; today someone offered me 15 to 20k per month to help them get oriented with ChatGPT.  Lucky, I found this great #AI by @OpenAI that allows me to ask their solution how to get oriented with ChatGPT. They need someone to ask ChatGPT about #ChatGPT. Fml, 2023

@christaggart That wasn't my experience. I asked, "Write a 200-word blog post about why you should heat with a heat pump in Ontario instead of a furnace," and this was the response. #heatpumps #ChatGPT  https://t.co/PuZOim1W1B
As we look to the future, #ConversationalAI will become closer to an actual human conversation.    However, to truly make it a humanlike interaction, there‚Äôs one piece we think is essential‚Äîa human-sounding voice:  https://t.co/FsLqyigSul  #ChatGPT  https://t.co/Bs98rUQAbp

My family tried using ChatGPT in English, and it was quite an interesting experience. When I ask if I know Mr. „Äá„Äá, he answers, but in some places information with the same surname and the same name is mixed. When I pointed out the error, he apologized properly that I had made a mistake, and after a while, he asked the same question and it was correct.  #ChatGPT https://t.co/nYuU4MBLH1
I asked #ChatGPT to explain carpentry in the style of a valley girl. Not disappointed.  https://t.co/F0I2KNaZcx

#AI becoming a co-author is indeed a new jump start! The next challenge would be how many #ChatGPT #bots can write a @Nature or @TheLancet papers and address review comments (perhaps keeping the second reviewer well responded)!   https://t.co/ykdNX6wWm7
AI chatbots are becoming 'tools' to support the writing of malicious code by black hat hackers. No need to know programming, just know the function the malicious code wants to perform #ChatGPT #CyberSecurity #Hacking.  https://t.co/GfK7bKO4x4
Here is an example of a very interesting #ChatGPT interaction. At first, it denied that a character named ‚ÄúFlitcraft‚Äù existed in the novel ‚ÄúThe Maltese Falcon.‚Äù I hit the retry button. It then identified the character and linked it to Peirce‚Äôs #philosophy of Tychism. #literature  https://t.co/J3irlskb8q
Ask #chatgpt to write you #youtube #socialmedia descriptions and ads using #ai.  You will be surprised with the results.  In this case I just gave it a title, so I ended up getting some copy that's not  accurate.  But it's a good starting point!  https://t.co/45fcdUU3lM

Once passed the test of forcing #ChatGPT to do "school work", I have begun to try it in two things that have surprised me how well it solves them: create stories and stories and consult things of the day to day that arise to me.
