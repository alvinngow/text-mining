#ChatGPT ‚Äôs ability to explain the difference between Arminianism and Calvinism is better than most church goers.
As with many other fields affected by AI, those in the upper echelons of the talent pool will be catalyzed while others are no longer be needed. Amateur evangelizers will need to beef up their skills to compete with LLMs like #ChatGPT.

Only me who really like using #OpenAI #ChatGPT for casual research and a tool in order to look over stuff? Can throw anything at it and ask anything revolving it. From finding better wordings or rephrasing full paragraphs to describe stuff. This tweet is not ran though it though.
Today I played #ChatGPT a bit, first let this artificial intelligence platform write an English love song, which is really good, and let it answer "how to overthrow one-party dictatorship", the first answer is barely passable, let it further elaborate is a bit wrong. Obviously, ChatGPT is not smart enough, but I believe that over time, it will provide an actionable solution to overthrow autocracy.

So, I've been testing out ChatGPT for the past few weeks and I have to say, I am blown away by how well it's been handling everything I throw at it. From creating simple social media captions to tackling complex math problems and program codes, it's been killing it. #chatgpt #AI  https://t.co/9KUK5B3uPi

Maybe AI is really intelligent sometimes. #ChatGPT
#ChatGPT reminds me of bad, dishonest and/or overconfident students who know the rough formal structure of an induction-proof and try to FAKE one (despite NOT having understood the problem). When grading exams, such behavior results in MUCH additional wasted time for the graders.
We decided to start a super easy to use website where you can browse 150+ prompts (inspired by the github repo), easily copy/paste and try on ChatGPT, and even submit your own.

@ioannismou Yeah #ChatGPT can code albeit has bugs and sometimes ascribes methods to classes that do not belong to them, but it good at making comments. Since I exclusively code in python now I use javscript to make websites but not program scientifically with it as such.

The following is NOT the "m√ºndliche Pr√ºfung" I mentioned in the OP.

Fascinating priming process getting #chatgpt to find answers. I'm sure it would become second nature after a while, but for now wild. As soon as it knows where you are, it's ahead of you, but you have to trick it into knowing where you are, aka express where you are it its terms?
